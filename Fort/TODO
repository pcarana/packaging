1. `debian/changelog`: I suppose you can add entries to this file for now, but
   once the package is uploaded to Debian, in should only include one entry.
   (The "Initial release (Closes: #XXXXX)" one. See Jool's.)
2. `debian/compat`: There's already a new compat version (12), although
   upgrading is sometimes not trivial.
3. `debian/control`: Standards-Version is too old. Adjust according to the
   Policy Manual you're reading. (https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/)
4. `debian/control`: Vcs-Git should include -b:

   Vcs-* fields are for packaging. There is not issue to
   share upstream Git for that, but this means you should have some
   branch dedicated for Debian packaging (like "debian") who is based on
   the tag you are currently packaging (and when you update the upstream
   version, you merge master in this branch). Then, you can point
   Vcs-Browser to the branch, as well as Vcs-Git (with "-b debian")

   See the policy manual.

And make sure you check the the package using the latest Lintian version.
Ubuntu's Lintian is too old; use Debian's.
