fort (1.0.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Bug fix: Solved github issue #11 "ROAs, MFTs and CAs created with revoked
    certs are valids".
  * Bug fix: Solved github issue #12 "Programming error when a ROA without
    prefixes is validated".
  * Bug fix: Solved github issue #13 "Wrong "serial number X is not unique"
    error is displayed when an MFT expired error happens".
  * Bug fix: Solved github issue #14 "FORT using server mode cannot be
    interrupted on OpenBSD with SIGINT signal (Control+C)".
  * Bug fix: The whole set of multiple SLURM files wasn't rejected in overlap
    cases (RFC 8416 section 4.2).
  * Bug fix: Validate "server.port" numeric value, since the function
    "getaddrinfo" is a bit lax with numeric values (it takes into account only
    the 16 rightmost bits).
  * Bug fix: Log the configured "server.address" instead of always log "any" as
    the server address.
  * Bug fix: Validate "output.roa" file path at initialization.
  * Bug fix: LibreSSL couldn't decode base64 text with line breaks where at
    least one line had more than 80 chars.
  * Bug fix: Remove invalid memory release when a TAL wasn't successfully
    loaded.
  * Bug fix: Some files needed by the unit tests were not exporting.
  * Bug fix: Join each client thread when the connection is terminated.
  * Bug fix: Avoid memory leak caused by X509_VERIFY_PARAM.
  * Bug fix: Patch bad initialization of CRL stack.
  * Bug fix: SLURM filters weren't correctly applied when an asn and prefix
    were set, only the asn was taken into account to filter VRPs.
  * Bug fix: SLURM filters of covering prefixes were ignored; e.g. if a prefix
    X covered ROA prefix Y, the ROA prefix wasn't filtered.
 
  * Update: In case of a SLURM error, log the JSON element with the error
    instead of logging the element number.
  * Update: Log a warning when a configuration path ("slurm", "tal") contains 0
    expected files (extensions ".slurm", ".tal").
  * Update: Configuration property "maximum-certificate-depth" now has a
    minimum allowed value of 5 to allow a regular validation using RIR TALs.
  * Update: The incidence "Signed Object's hash algorithm has NULL object as
    parameters" now has the ID "incid-hashalg-has-params", and by default it
    has an action of "ignore".
  * Update: Update information displayed by "--help" at "--tal" and "--slurm"
    flags.
  * Update: Show ROA eContent in debug mode.
  * Update: Retry file download when there's an error related to a manifest
    file.
  * Update: Set compiler optimization level ("-O") from "0" to "2".
  * Display RTR server info when successfully binded.
  * Log property name on value error (for unsigned integer values).
  * Remove compile warning '_BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE are deprecated'.
  * Log custom incidences on initialization.

  * Docs: Indicate current support for 64 bits OSs. 32 bit archs MAY present
    the 2038 Year Problem.
  * Docs: Add installation steps for: CentOS 7, Fedora 30, openSUSE Leap,
    FreeBSD 12, Slackware current release (as of 2019-08-12)
  * Docs: Add minimum dependencies version required: Openssl >= 1.1.0,
    GCC >= 4.9.
  * Docs: Update incidences section, now the registered incidence has a
    distinct ID and a default action of "ignore".
  * Docs: Update link to "UINT_MAX" definition at usage section.
  * Docs: Use path "/tmp/fort/<path>" at multiple examples (man, web docs).
