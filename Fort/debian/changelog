  * Bug fix: Validate 'output.bgpsec' path, check if the path is writable
    during configuration checks.
  * Bug fix: Fix bad PDU exchange when the ROAs/Router Keys DB was empty, an
    End of Data was being sent when a Reset Query PDU was received.

  * Update: Add missing validation from RFC 7935 section 3 (subjectPublicKey
    modulus and exponent).
  * Update: Use type 'blksize_t' (<sys/types.h>) instead of '__blksize_t'
    (<bits/types.h>) to avoid a specific compilation error on Alpine Linux.

fort (1.1.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Update: Create a thread to rsync and validate each TAL, trying to improve
    execution time.
  * Update: Support RTR version 1:
    -RTR version negotiation.
    -Validate version during PDU exchange.
    -Implement new PDU error "Unexpected Protocol Version".
    -Implement new PDU type "Router Key".
    -Add timing parameters to "End of Data PDU".
  * Update: Support BGPsec EE certificates (validate and consider for deltas)
    accordingly to RFC 8209 and 8608.
  * Update: Update configuration parameters:
    -Rename 'server.validation-interval' to 'server.interval.validation'.
    -Add 'server.interval.refresh', 'server.interval.retry', and
    'server.interval.expire' args to use at RTR version 1 "End of Data PDU".
    -Add "output.bgpsec' (similar to 'output.roa') to print valid Router Keys,
    the information is printed as base64url encoded strings.
  * Update: Support BGPsec filters and assertions at SLURM files.
  * Update: Use syslog when running in server mode, print at console otherwise.
  * Update: Update unit tests.

  * Docs: Indicate full RFC 8209 compliance.
  * Docs: Add RFCs compliance (they were missing): 6810, 8210, 8416, 8608, 8630.
  * Docs: Update SLURM module with BGPsec assertions and filters support, as
    well as some examples.
  * Docs: Update Usage module:
    -Rename to 'Program Arguments'.
    -Updated configuration property ('server.validation-interval' is now
    'server.interval.validation').
    -New properties ('server.interval.refresh', 'server.interval.retry',
    'server.interval.expire', and 'output.bgpsec').
    -Show which 'output.roa' headers are printed.
  * Docs: Use the same layout at home (landing page) to avoid multiple clicks
    in order to reach the docs.
  * Docs: Use a similar configuration file as example at web docs and user man.
  * Docs: Add Logging module to explain how the logs work.
  * Docs: Update root README with basic information about the project. 
  * Docs: Update user man: indicate RTR version 1 support, and add the same
    updates as in the web docs.

fort (1.0.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Bug fix: Solved github issue #11 "ROAs, MFTs and CAs created with revoked
    certs are valids".
  * Bug fix: Solved github issue #12 "Programming error when a ROA without
    prefixes is validated".
  * Bug fix: Solved github issue #13 "Wrong "serial number X is not unique"
    error is displayed when an MFT expired error happens".
  * Bug fix: Solved github issue #14 "FORT using server mode cannot be
    interrupted on OpenBSD with SIGINT signal (Control+C)".
  * Bug fix: The whole set of multiple SLURM files wasn't rejected in overlap
    cases (RFC 8416 section 4.2).
  * Bug fix: Validate "server.port" numeric value, since the function
    "getaddrinfo" is a bit lax with numeric values (it takes into account only
    the 16 rightmost bits).
  * Bug fix: Log the configured "server.address" instead of always log "any" as
    the server address.
  * Bug fix: Validate "output.roa" file path at initialization.
  * Bug fix: LibreSSL couldn't decode base64 text with line breaks where at
    least one line had more than 80 chars.
  * Bug fix: Remove invalid memory release when a TAL wasn't successfully
    loaded.
  * Bug fix: Some files needed by the unit tests were not exporting.
  * Bug fix: Join each client thread when the connection is terminated.
  * Bug fix: Avoid memory leak caused by X509_VERIFY_PARAM.
  * Bug fix: Patch bad initialization of CRL stack.
  * Bug fix: SLURM filters weren't correctly applied when an asn and prefix
    were set, only the asn was taken into account to filter VRPs.
  * Bug fix: SLURM filters of covering prefixes were ignored; e.g. if a prefix
    X covered ROA prefix Y, the ROA prefix wasn't filtered.
 
  * Update: In case of a SLURM error, log the JSON element with the error
    instead of logging the element number.
  * Update: Log a warning when a configuration path ("slurm", "tal") contains 0
    expected files (extensions ".slurm", ".tal").
  * Update: Configuration property "maximum-certificate-depth" now has a
    minimum allowed value of 5 to allow a regular validation using RIR TALs.
  * Update: The incidence "Signed Object's hash algorithm has NULL object as
    parameters" now has the ID "incid-hashalg-has-params", and by default it
    has an action of "ignore".
  * Update: Update information displayed by "--help" at "--tal" and "--slurm"
    flags.
  * Update: Show ROA eContent in debug mode.
  * Update: Retry file download when there's an error related to a manifest
    file.
  * Update: Set compiler optimization level ("-O") from "0" to "2".
  * Display RTR server info when successfully binded.
  * Log property name on value error (for unsigned integer values).
  * Remove compile warning '_BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE are deprecated'.
  * Log custom incidences on initialization.

  * Docs: Indicate current support for 64 bits OSs. 32 bit archs MAY present
    the 2038 Year Problem.
  * Docs: Add installation steps for: CentOS 7, Fedora 30, openSUSE Leap,
    FreeBSD 12, Slackware current release (as of 2019-08-12)
  * Docs: Add minimum dependencies version required: Openssl >= 1.1.0,
    GCC >= 4.9.
  * Docs: Update incidences section, now the registered incidence has a
    distinct ID and a default action of "ignore".
  * Docs: Update link to "UINT_MAX" definition at usage section.
  * Docs: Use path "/tmp/fort/<path>" at multiple examples (man, web docs).
